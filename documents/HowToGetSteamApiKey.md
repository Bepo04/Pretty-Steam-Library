# STEAM CREDENTIALS TUTORIAL

## HOW TO GET YOUR STEAM API KEY

1. **Visit https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey**

    If you see an error that asks you for Steam Guard Atuenticator, go to step 2, if you see a form, go to step 3

2. **Steam Guard activation**

    You need to install the Steam Mobile App for mobile and add a phone number to your Steam Account.    

    In the mobile app, you have to go to Steam Guard and configure an authenticator with your phone number.

    You should follow this oficial guide:

    Once you're done, repeat step 1, and you should see a form. If that's the case, you are ready for step 3

3. **Getting our Steam Api Key**

    Here Steams asks you for a domain name. If it's for personal use, this name doesn't really matter.   
    I recomend to use some basic name as "localhost" or "myname".

    Then, you have to accept terms of use, and click in the "Register" button.

    It may asks you for a mobile confirmation. If that's the case, you've to go tu the confirmations section
    in the Steam Mobile app, and confirm the API KEY request.

4. **Save your Steam API Key**  
    If everything has gone OK, you will see your Steam API Key in the same page, copy it, and save in a secure way
